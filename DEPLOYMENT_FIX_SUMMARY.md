# Vercel DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND - Quick Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed

The error occurred because Vercel couldn't properly build and deploy your application due to missing dependencies and an unclear entry point configuration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `api/index.js`
```javascript
// Vercel serverless function entry point
const app = require('./src/index.js');
module.exports = app;
```

**Why:** Vercel needs a clear entry point at the project root level to build serverless functions.

### 2. Updated `vercel.json`
- Changed `api/src/index.js` → `api/index.js` in builds configuration
- Added proper function configuration (memory, timeout)

**Why:** The path must match the actual entry point file.

### 3. Added `@vercel/node` dependency
```bash
cd api && npm install
```
This added the `@vercel/node` package which is required for Express apps on Vercel.

**Why:** Without this package, Vercel can't properly convert your Express app into serverless functions.

## What to Do Next

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd api && npm install
   cd ../frontend && npm install
   ```

2. **Test locally (optional):**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   vercel dev
   ```

3. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

4. **Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard:**
   - `POSTGRES_URL` (or other database connection)
   - `JWT_SECRET`
   - `FRONTEND_URL`
   - Any other required environment variables

## Expected Result

- ✅ Frontend builds successfully
- ✅ API serverless function builds successfully  
- ✅ Deployment completes without `DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND` error
- ✅ Your app is accessible at your Vercel URL
- ✅ `/api/*` routes work correctly
- ✅ `/health` endpoint responds

## If You Still Have Issues

1. Check Vercel deployment logs for specific errors
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Ensure database is accessible from Vercel's network
4. Review the detailed guide: `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND_FIX.md`

## Key Concepts

- **Vercel uses serverless functions**, not traditional servers
- **Dependencies must be explicitly installed** in each directory
- **Entry points must be clearly defined** in `vercel.json`
- **Build happens before deployment** - issues are caught early
